\section*{1.1}
\subsection*{1.1--1}
Rank in competition requires sorting.

\subsection*{1.1--2}
Use of space.

\subsection*{1.1--3}
Array. It can efficiently index but isn't good at growing or shrinking
dynamically.

\subsection*{1.1--4}
They are similar, because each of then has to walk a graph and find a path in them.

The difference is the constraint on the solution. The shortest-path requires
just a  path between two points, while the traveling salesman requires a path
between more  points that returns to the first point.

\subsection*{1.1--5}
A single-solution maze requests best solution. Finding a path between two points
in a city requires an ``approximately'' best solution.


\section*{1.2}
\subsection*{1.2--1}
Finding  pictures containing people from many pictures requires machine learning
algorithm. A better algorithm can find such pictures efficiently and correctly.

\subsection*{1.2--2}
$n > 43$

\subsection*{1.2--3}
$n > 14$
